# DartGodot

Its support all Godot Mono Platforms : Android , IOS , Web , Windows , ...

Im currently working on a Dart2Godot crossplatform compiler to use dart in godot without pain and hard configs

next step is implementing api , its easy but its too time consuming

**NOTE :** The project is currently under heavy development and it's unusable for now
