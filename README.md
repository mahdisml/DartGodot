# WARNING

DartGodot is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change (now is the time to make suggestions!). Important features are missing.There is no Documentation for now. Please don't build any serious projects in DartGodot unless you are prepared to be broken by api changes constantly.

# Development Status
<del>
Im currently working on a Dart2Godot crossplatform compiler to use dart in godot without pain and hard configs
</del>

(we must wait for godot 4 (beta) !)
Im currently working on implementing api , its easy but its too time consuming
