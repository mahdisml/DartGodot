# DartGodot
Dart + Godot + New Game Programming Style

It support all Godot Mono Platforms : Android , IOS , Web , Windows , ...

This is not a dart game engine , but it will make godot a dart game engine !

This is not only a language binding , its a new game programming style !

**NOTE :** The project is currently under heavy development and it's unusable for now

Im currently working on a Dart2Godot crossplatform compiler to use dart in godot without pain and hard configs

next step is implementing api , its easy but its too time consuming

Support me by giving Star :)
